Lazy loading prevents the loading of images that aren't really needed on the screen immediately, as you scroll down or closer to the image, the image beings to load.

```html
<img scr="image.png" loading="lazy" width="200" height="200" />
```

Here's the [demo](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/img-loading-lazy).
